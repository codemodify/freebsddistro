If to stay to think, you realize that economically commercial
applications drags humans to stagnation or degradation.<br>
Matemathically can be demonstrated that commercials that are translated
to as "closed systems" are designed to disappear, <br>
this way they drag everything that they interact with.<br>
<br>
From purely human point of view I hate seeing "25$ zero level quality"
applications being sold, and because people do not <br>
have choise they struggle with them. I call the creators of such
'useful
applications' that after some time dare to call <br>
themselves software-architects&nbsp; -&nbsp; trivial money-hijackers.<br>
<br>
Overall there is a lack of basic, free, high quality tools that will
allow people communicate. continously.<br>
The only way for humans to speedup the research areas in their academic
activities is for them to have the exchange of <br>
information, without any limits. Probably this will include changing
the nature of the transport layers that transports that <br>
information,
because this is a component that negatively reflects on the speed.<br>
<br>
By means of ISP, I want to contribute with a small brick to make
available to large groups of people, a set of basic features <br>
that will enable them to not think of anything else except of their
task/inspiration/duty. That will include starting from <br>
academic areas to the home users without any official academic
affiliation. <br>
<br>
ISP is trying to enable every wanting person to start to think without
any borders imposed by any standards.<br>
This is done so because the very this moment sometimes brings amazing
rezults.<br>
<br>
Why I know this is because I have seen people that are driven by these
moments. Usually they are the ones that become <br>
effective leaders, sometimes with positive feed-back on the others that
they were
interacting with. If to have more open <br>
systems of such level, the
feed-back effect can be amplified many times.
