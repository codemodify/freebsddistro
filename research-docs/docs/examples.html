<h2>What is this paper about</h2>
<br>
<small>Here is explained how to create complex software using ISP as a
play field where you can:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o let go your imagination fly they way it can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o implement models that prooves the concepts of you
research work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o implement production quality software used for
hardcore operations<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this is done in a quick and elegant manier that
allows you to focus on the core of the feature.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to be able to understand the examples and
later implement custom functionalities,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you will need to get a general knowlege of the
logics Internet Server Platform provides.<br>
</small><br>
<br>
<h2>What is Internet Server Platform (ISP)<br>
</h2>
<small>ISP - is a software platform which having the core only it does
nothing useful, but in combination with modules<br>
that provide custom functionalities becomes a shapeless and powerfull
tool that has as aim to channel data between people.<br>
The core is nothing, a module is nothing, together they become an
extension to each other.<br>
<br>
The things that ISP provides in a transparent manner for a module are:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Stream oriented connections. So far TCP is the
only one used.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Secured stream oriented connections. So far SSL
over TCP is the only one used.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Secured private spaces called 'bottles'. A module
can have any number of bottles. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For making things uber secure
bottles use two keys.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Data gatewaying in format n&lt;-&gt;m.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Flexible techniques of securing against potential
intruders.<br>
<br>
The things that ISP provides for the person that configures it:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o trivially simple configuration, <a
 href="../../../docs/internet-server-platform.settings">here</a> is an
example.<br>
<br>
What a module is likely to do if one is imminent to explode into life:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o inherit a basic interface provided by the ISP so
they can communicate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o implement the only one method to handle the
request arrived to this module<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o use ISP's facilities to transfer data in the
direction it wants<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o if the module wants a secure connection, then it
asks for it and it will be provided.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o at the moment the request arrives, if the module
was asking for a secure connection, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the data that came was comming on
secure connection, otherwise it won't come.</small><br>
