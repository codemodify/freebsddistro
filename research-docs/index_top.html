<a href="mysd/docs/index.html">mysd</a> - an experiment in providing a software platform for servers, desktops, development.
    It is entirely written in <a href="http://www.trolltech.com">Trolltech</a>'s QT toolkit.
    An .iso image can be found <a href="ftp://ftp.nikushor.eu/research-lab/computing/sd/mysd/mysd.iso">here</a>, it contains a FreeBSD based distribution with all the concepts 
    implemented as described in "<a href="mysd/docs/index.html">mysd</a>".
    
    For fun <a href="mysd/docs/old_docs/intro.html">here</a> are some history docs.
    They are obsolete because the project was taken to a different level.
    
    Through the <a href="http://www.nikushor.eu/research-lab/computing/sd/mysd/server/internet-server-platform/docs/index.html">Internet Server Platform</a> this distribution can serve 
    also as node in the <a href="http://www.nikushor.eu/research-lab/computing/cm/index.html">CM</a> architecture,
    this way you get very promising capabilitiesin areas like:<span style="font-weight: bold;">
    search-engines, databases, distributed-file-systems, colaborative-working, 
    home-automation-systems, as well as in centralized or distributed monitoring of flows of data.
