It should be enough to do just:

make
make install

The build was tested on Linux and FreeBSD with Qt-2.3.0. Qt is available
at Trolltech (www.trolltech.com). Earlier Qt2 versions should work but are
not tested.

A problem could still occur if Qt was not correctly installed to compile
programs. See the INSTALL file in Qt for information - your QTDIR environment
variable must point to the Qt base directory, otherwise you get errors.

Make install will place all files in a common hierarchy below /usr/local/qlwm
(you can change this in the toplevel makefile), one additional link to 
qlwm in /usr/local/bin, a directory ~/.qlwm in your home directory (this will
not be overwritten if you upgrade) and the manpage. The simplest way to make
X11 aware of it is however by running qlwm from your ~/.xinitrc file if you
start X11 with a startx command or from ~/.xsession if you use xdm login. You
should see something that is preconfigured enough to start work with it.

See the manpage for usage information. The latest version can be found at
http://get.to/qlwm.
