It should be enough to do just:

make
make install

then change back to your user account and type:

make install-config

to create your private ~/.qlwm configuration directory. 

The build was tested on Linux and FreeBSD with Qt-3.2.0. A problem could
still occur if Qt was not correctly installed to compile programs. See the
INSTALL file in Qt for information - your QTDIR environment variable must
point to the Qt base directory, otherwise you get errors. Default is to
link against threaded Qt (-thread). 

Make install will place all files in a common hierarchy below /usr/local/qlwm
(you can change this in the toplevel makefile), one additional link to 
qlwm in /usr/local/bin, and the manpage. The simplest way to make X11 aware
of it is however by running qlwm from your ~/.xinitrc file if you start X11
with a startx command or from ~/.xsession if you use xdm login. You should
see something that is preconfigured enough to start work with it.

See the manpage for usage information. The latest version can be found at
