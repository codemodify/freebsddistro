Phluid is a window manager that emphasizes efficiency, speed, and beauty.
It uses rasterman's Imlib2 library as the image/font rendering backend.
Phluid also attempts to be flexible and compliant with the ICCCM standard, 
although it has a long way to go in reaching the standard.  Phluid gets a
lot of it's inspiration from the enlightenment window manager, but some of
the initial code design is based on aewm, a very minimalistic window manager
(Thanks, Decklin Foster, for giving me a great reference implementation to
start with).
