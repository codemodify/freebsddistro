Things to do
============

(sorted by priority, first comes the highest)

* Make Code gcc-4.0 (-pedantic -Wall) clean
  * mostly finished, except src/session.c*
  * REMOVE the current session.(c|h)

* REMOVE automake - use autoconf and a hand-written Makefile - automake sucks badly!

* Switch to C++!

* Write new documentation. Doxygen needs to be written.

* Switch to XRestackWindows for raising/lowering.

* Implement *all* needed things from EWMH, mostly for Gnome2.
  (currently Gnome panels work again, *and* Oroborus registers itself with
  the Gnome session)

* implement a remote controlling application
  (like esh from enlightenment)

* Add a Gui application for configuring Oroborus more comfortable.

* Add a plugin interface.

* implement a popup funtion to warn the user

* Cleanup *all* of Oroborus to make it more flexible.

* Implement libxft2 support for the window decoration. (mostly for UTF-8 support).



Done and still in the TODO file
===============================

* Nothing yet ;)
