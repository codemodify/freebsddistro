Change log for Licq.

New in 1.2.0
o  Lots and lots of bug fixes
o  Memory management fixes
o  Per user encoding in QT plugin
o  Initial server side list support
o  Sending SMS
o  Improved buffer overflow prevention
o  ICQ CLB file converter
o  So many other things
  
New in 1.0.4
o  Bug fixes
o  workarounds for reoccuring offline messages
   and direct-sending problems with ICQ2001 clients added
o  Primary maintainer changed to Dirk Mueller <dirk@licq.org>

Note: This is the very last release that uses the old, not well
   working ICQv5 protocol (which was used by ICQ99a and ICQ99b). 
   There will be a new alpha release shortly that uses the new,
   more reliable protocol, that is also used by ICQ2001 clients. 

Note: This is the very last release of an outdated code base. 
   If it doesn't work for you, please help with the development
   of the new, ICQ2001 based protocol.

New in v0.43

o  Chat now supports remote end setting the background and foreground
   colors.
o  Options can almost all be set using a gui dialog.

   bottom (lets the main window be narrower).
o  Chat requests are properly cancelled when you close an unaccepted
   chat request dialog.
o  Translation fixed for urls.
o  About box added.
o  Added to contact list system message now shows the info on the user
   who added you.


New in v0.42
o  Added option to remove the header from the user list.
o  Added more translation stuff.
o  Fixed chat so that it works again.


New in v0.41

o  Added support for "invalid uin" return on an update user info.
o  Hopefully fixed flaw that made non alphabetic characters dissappear.
o  Added patch for character translations.
o  Auto away and NA after a given amount of time.


New in v0.40 final
o  Now you can select which columns are shown and the order in which they 
   appear and their width using the licq.conf file.
o  Font propagates properly throughout the entire program.
o  Support for other character sets.
o  No more licq.inst file, now when you run licq for the first time it
   will automatically install what it needs.
o  Set the background color for each type of user.  Basically you can set
   the background color of the main window now.
o  Fixed the bug that made licq crash if it was unable to connect to a
   user.
o  Events now appear in the correct order in the view event tab.
o  Fixed the bug that segfaulted Licq on URLs sent without a description.
o  Network window now scrolls properly downwards.


New in v0.40pr4
o  Chat!  Barely works.  Very iffy, but test it out.
o  Grid lines can be turned off using the menu.
o  Multiple function windows can now be opened at once.  Leaks a little 
   though.
o  Auto update all users function added.
o  Added support for PC Speaker for sound.  Just put in [sound], Enabled = 2
   or select it using the sound menu under options.
o  Set the background color for online, away, and offline users.  Edit the
   licq.conf file to select the colors.


New in v0.40pr3

o  Fixed the URL and description being reversed
o  Changed how reading events works.  Redid the Read Msg tab.
o  Added more error checking to the socket code.
o  Platform indepedence in the socket code hopefully.  Removed the problem
   with big-endian / little-endian numbers.
o  Fixed the names appearing halfway up the line in the main window.
o  Added lines to the main window.


New in v0.40pr2

o  Hopefully the double message thing and the various problems with the newest
   version of ICQ for windows are fixed.
o  Added server busy awareness.
o  Ability to go to the next server if the current one isn't working.
o  New messages are saved so that next time you start you will still
   see them (sort of).  Now if Licq crashes while you have new messages
   you won't lose them.
o  Started distributing Jeff's status icons as the default ones.  You can
   always use the other ones if you prefer.
o  Segfault which occured on a line larger than 57 characters fixed.
o  Pending events handled properly when you log off.  Basically Licq handles
   timeouts much better.
o  Send Through Server is sticky, so it remembers it's position for each user
   between calls.
o  Unaligned byte reading bug fixed so that Licq will run under Solaris and 
   other OS's...Unfortunately, there are still problems with endianess so
   Licq still requires an i386 processor to work.


New in v0.40pr1

o  Total restructuring of gui.  Uses Qt 1.4 ListView instead of list
   boxes.  Shows more information on each user in the window now.
   Status bar added, showing on/offline status, number of system 
   messages, and number of new messages.
o  Mini mode where Licq takes up much less screen real-estate.
o  Search User function added.  Search by first name, last name
   email address, or alias.
o  Send URL works.


New in v0.34

o  Word wrap works in read messages properly (wraps words instead of
   cutting them off)
o  Authorization has been added.  Now when users ask for authorization
   you see more of their information and the request.  And you can
   authorize users to add you with "Users" "Authorize User" menu
   option.
o  Fixed the vertical bars error in windows boxes.  Now Licq sends
   messages in DOS style (carriage return / newline) instead of UNIX
   style (newline only).
o  Icon added, thanks to Dave and the Gimp.
o  Docking now supported in WindowMaker, BlackBox...
o  Sound support added.  Currently only one sound which plays on
   incoming messages.
 

New in v0.33

o  Command-line options now work.  Try -d to dump some status debugging
   info and -b to set base directory (defaults to ~/.licq) and -h for
   help.
o  Word wrap works in the send message dialog!   Borrowed some code from
   KEdit and now it works.  Wrote some code to get it to work in other
   dialogs (such as read msg).  It's not perfect, but a patch will be
   released soon to fix it.
o  Licq no longer crashes if you aren't connected.  It runs fine and will
   simply give an error when you try and connect.
o  Major memory leak fixed, should make Licq more stable.
o  Foundation for multiple server support added.  
o  Licq now retries a set number of times before giving up on mirabilis 
   instead of stopping right away.
o  Fixed the annoying "Hide" button on the wrong side problem.  Now 
   everything is more standard and the window won't dissappear when you
   hit "enter".
o  Autoconf configuration thanks to Nic Bellamy.  Now you can just
   type configure to get everything working.
o  Rewrite of javaToLicq, making it much much better.  Thanks again
   to Nic Bellamy.
o  Restructure of directory structure again.  Now licq is installed
   in /usr/local/share/licq, but each user *has* to install it into
   their own ~/.licq directory.  Licq.inst has been rewriten to better
   accomodate this.


New in v0.32

o  Option to dump the network window output to a file to aid in deubugging.  
   Check box on the window itself toggles writting to BASE_DIR/netwin.debug
o  The network window now adds lines at the top instead of at the bottom, 
   making it much easier to keep track of what's going on.  No more jumping 
   all over the place to keep track of the most recent event. 
o  Licq now saves the size of the window and its position when it exits, and 
   restores it when you restart.  The information is stored in 
   conf/geometry.conf
o  Added users are automatically saved to disk.
o  New users (either added manually or automatically) are automatically updated 
   if you are online and their info saved.
o  Double clicking on a user with no new message now brings up the send message 
   tab instead of the read message one.
o  History is now editable and you can save changes to disk.
o  Remove user now works, including removing the config and history files.
o  Selecting a function for a user when the function window is already open now 
   updates the function window instead of doing nothing.
o  javaToLicq and micqToLicq scripts have been updated to actually work.
o  Major reimplementation of the directory code.  Now Licq installs to 
   /usr/local/licq (you can change this, but I don't recommend it) and will 
   default read the config data from here.  But you can specify a different 
   BASE_DIR on the command line to give each user a seperate configuration.
   For example, running "licq" will start up licq using /usr/local/licq as the 
   BASE_DIR and running "licq ~/.licq" will start licq using ~/.licq as the 
   BASE_DIR.  I recommend putting the later as an alias and using it.
o  New users are now marked in a different color until you open the function window
   for them.  This allows you to tell how is new and who isn't.  
o  Licq can now detect if a packet has come from another Licq client and will
   indicate this and the version number on the network window for each incoming tcp 
   packet.
