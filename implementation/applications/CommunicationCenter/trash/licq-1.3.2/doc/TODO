List of things to do and in progress for Licq:
o  Get multiple owners (including of the same protocol) working.
o  User-friendly GPG functions. Managing keys, disabling encryption, etc.
o  Yahoo and MSN protocol plugins. (MSN is being worked on now.. Yahoo anyone?)
o  Any (valid) bug listed on SF.  It would be best to talk with me first if
   you decide to fix one of these, as I probably know what is wrong and what
   to do to fix it.

Other Things:
o  Have licq automatically detect the status of ppp0 and go online/offline
   accordingly
o  Fix auto-update all users
o  Auto accept file option
o  Viewing user info without adding user to list

Plugin Ideas:
o  Email checker (what happened to the mailchecker plugin?)
o  Web server
