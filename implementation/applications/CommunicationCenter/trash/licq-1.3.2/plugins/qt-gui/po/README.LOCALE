Licq Qt-GUI Translation Support


Creating a Translation File

First create the basic template by doing "make template".  Then rename
this file to something a bit more descriptive, such as ru.po.  Edit your
new file and fill in all the necessary translations.


Using a translation File

Once the .po file has been created, it must be converted into a Qt qm file.
This is done using the msg2qm routine, which can be invoked using 
"make <lang>.qm" assuming <lang>.po exists.  Once you have the .qm file,
simply copy it to <licq prefix>/share/licq/qt-gui/locale/<lang>.qm.  Then set
the environment variable LANGUAGE (or LANG) to the two digit language code
(as per GNU gettext standard) and it will be loaded next time the Qt-GUI
is started.  For example, to use a russian translation do:
> cd po
> cp /the/dir/ru_RU.KOI8-R.po .
> make qm
> cp ru_RU.KOI8R.qm /usr/local/share/licq/qt-gui/locale
> export LANG="ru_RU.KOI8-R"


Updating a Translation File

All the text strings are updated with each new Licq release, it is necessary
to update the .po files.  This is done simply by placing the old .po file
in the po directory and running "make merge".  This simply calls the mergetr
program, which comes with Qt.  The new .po file can now be edited and any
necessary translations added.

export LANG=ru_RU.KOI8-R
set translation in licq to RUSSIAN_WIN

this is the end (c)

weird cyrillisation
it's not needed

OK, this is your problem. You are using a rude hack that was acceptable
2 or 3 years ago, but you shouldn't use it now. Most programs nowdays are
more or less properly localized and you are going to have more and more
troubles with this approach.

Do the following:
1) run locale -a|grep '^ru' to see which russian locales you have on your
machine. Try to figure out which one is KOI8-R (on my machine it is
ru_RU.KOI8-R). If it does not have "KOI8-R" in its name explicitly, take a
look at /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/locale.* and make sure that your locale
of choice is not mapped to ISO-8859-5 locale in X.
2)Make sure you have environment variables
LANG=ru_RU.KOI8-R
LC_NUMERIC=C
set _before_ your window manager is started. To test if it worked
correctly, start xterm with some cyrillic fond and run "date". You should
get the date in russian.
3) Remove your aliases.
4) Make sure you are using Netscape at least 4.x
5) Edit your /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/Netscape and replace
references to *-iso8859-1 fonts with references to *-koi8-r fonts where it
makes sense.
6) Run licq, tell it that you want to use koi8-r fonts and it would work
fine (works for me).
